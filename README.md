# HumbleBundleScraper
A service that retrieves a list of book titles that are packaged in a book bundle on Humble Bundle. Everytime a new book bundle comes out, the service will generate a booklist and search for any free download links on z-books or other sites. The service exposes a RESTful API for its mailing list, in which the user can add their email address to receive the latest booklists, along with links to a free download of the book, in their email inbox. You can also respond to any email from the service with the message "favorite", "add to favourites", "add to favorites: book1 book2 ..." to add the given books or list of books to your favourites list, which can be queried via another API. The service will expose its API via 2 routes: you can respond or send emails to the service to invoke the API, or you can use the REST API directly. There are 2 ways of authenticating: emails from your address are assumed to be you, otherwise you use the RESTful API with OAuth2. The service will be designed from the backend and API first. Afterwards, I may do a basic web gui in react.
